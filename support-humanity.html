                <p>Even though the winter is welcomed by the privileged affluent people in gleeful moods, it brings a lot of suffering to the poor people. But many poor people in our country cannot afford to buy warm clothes for winter. During the winter season, we takes initiative to distribute warm clothes among the unprivileged area to reduce suffering. This initiative might not mitigate all their problems but may remit their sufferings to a little extent.</p>
